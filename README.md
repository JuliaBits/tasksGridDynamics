Task1
Coffee Machine

In this project, I worked on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. It also collects the money.

Task2
Flashcards

When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint on one side and the right answer on the other. You can add new card, ask for the hardest card based on your progress, import and export cards from file etc.

Task3
Contacts

In this project, I worked on a program to create contacts (like on the mobile phone) and search for people or organizations by name.

Task4
Encryption/Decryption

This project is about encryption and decryption of data. You can choose Ceasar or Unicode mode to encrypt or decrypt the input or file.
